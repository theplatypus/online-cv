      tagline: "My thesis contribution to graph isomorphism problem."
      details: |
        
        - canonization algorithm working on fully labeled graphs (vertices and edges)
        - provides for any graph a tree representant of its isomorphism class
        - well suited for low-connected graphs (e.g. molecules)

      tagline: "Low latency, middleware ReST wrapper of a pool of R interpreters."
      details: |

        - Has been used to provide real-time access to a pricing model (retail) running in R
        - Key point is to pipe the incoming HTTP request to a pool of interpreters kept opened
        - < 20ms of additional latency.
