        tagline: "My thesis contribution to graph isomorphism problem."
        details: |
          
          - canonization algorithm working on fully labeled graphs (vertices and edges)
          - provides for any graph a tree representant of its isomorphism class
          - well suited for low-connected graphs (e.g. molecules)

        details: |

          - Has been used to provide real-time access to a pricing model (retail) running in R
          - Key point is to pipe the incoming HTTP request to a pool of interpreters kept opened
          - < 20ms of additional latency.
